## Introduction
This is just a small "Tëmp Kaxkëni" interpreter written in Python.   
The name literally means "Brain break it".     
This is basically just brainfuck but with Lenape words instead of symbols.   

```
> becomes mayai
< becomes amemànchi
+ becomes òk
- becomes chitën 	
. becomes kòchëmink	
, becomes lamunkwe
[ becomes hè	
] becomes xùch
```
hè is hello    
xùch is a future marker     
lamunkwe means inside     
kòchëmink means outdoors          
òk means "and" but can be used in addition            
chitën means [minus](https://talk-lenape.org/results?query=chit%C3%ABn&lang=lenape)                 
mayai means on the right                
amemànchi means ["on the left; left-handedly"](https://talk-lenape.org/detail?id=414)                 

Usage:           
run the python file with your .lenape after it.        

## Example folder

helloworld.lenape prints a python hello world program    
myemail.lenape prints my email that's on my README, my portfolio email.     
fourthcrow.lenape prints the [fourth crow prophecy](https://archive.ph/8bpE1) from the Lenape Nation of PA onto the command line.
